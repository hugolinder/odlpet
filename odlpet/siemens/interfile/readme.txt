This is based on Siemens interfile files, which are partly public. 
Siemens mMR data is available via STIR https://github.com/UCL/STIR/tree/master/examples/Siemens-mMR
on https://zenodo.org/record/1304454 , but I do not know any public mCT data. 
STIR also has implemented utilities for reading Siemens interfile.
